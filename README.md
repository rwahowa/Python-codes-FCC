# Small Python projects follow along code

## Create virtual env for your projects

Do it for every project you start.

```py
python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Optional:** On linux or mac create a permanent alias for python3

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc

#Add the following at the end of your bashrc file
#This aliases python3 to py
alias py=python3

```

If using zsh, you should edit zshrc file.

*`Nano Tip:`* - Press `CTRL + End` to go to the end of the file.

The different projects will be housed in different directories. Go into any folder to learn more about each project. **More projects will be added soon**
